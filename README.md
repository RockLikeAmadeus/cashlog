# cashlog
This is version 0.1. In a future version, functionality may be split between separate repositories.

The initial version will be written in Python, but an executable wrapper may be created one day for ease of use. The plan is to keep this initial version simple in order to simply determine optimal usage. Refactoring can be done once its clear exactly how cashlog should be used.
